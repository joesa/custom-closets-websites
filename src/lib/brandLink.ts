/**
 * Hrefs a brand/logo link must never keep.
 *
 * The obvious cases are empty, "#" and javascript:. The one that actually bit
 * us is subtler: a logo whose href points at an *asset*. Selecting the brand
 * link in the editor and applying an image URL set the anchor's href (that is
 * what "Apply to selection" does to an <a>), so Alvarado's logo linked to
 * /api/a/<token> — clicking it downloaded a JPEG instead of going home. A
 * repair that only looked for empty/#/javascript: left it in place.
 *
 * Kept deliberately narrow: real destinations ("/", "/about", an external
 * site) must pass, or logos stop linking where they should.
